    Hi, my name is Jess and welcome to The Light Tree. 


    Whatever your age, shape, size, ethnicity, social background, whether you
    want to strengthen your body or create more flexibility, maybe you are
    looking for some time for yourself or learn how to be calmer, you could be
    on a journey of self-realisation, Yoga is a system of transformation that
    can be accessed by everyone. 


    I run group classes, workshops and private sessions for all abilities and I
    am passionate about helping you to energise your body, calm your mind,
    nourish your soul and shine your light.
