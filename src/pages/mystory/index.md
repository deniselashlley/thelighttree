content: >-
  I have been a practitioner of Yoga since 2002 and began teaching Yoga in since
  2015. 

  I discovered Yoga in a time of transition while I was ending a 9 year
  relationship and I was looking for some respite, solace and ‘me’ time. 


  At the end of my first class I felt amazing, so I went back for another and
  another.  I discovered that through simply spending a regular 90 minutes with
  myself focused on breathing, moving and becoming still I began to become
  closer to myself, feel better about myself and in my body. I also started to
  become aware of some of my limiting beliefs that were preventing me from
  moving forward that showed up in my practice. My practice mat was like a
  mirror! I was awoken to the fact that I had not been looking after myself and
  this had led me to become disconnected, have a lack of clarity of who I was,
  what I wanted or how to move forward.


  I had a realisation that putting myself first was necessary to my physical,
  mental, emotional and spiritual health. Self-care was not selfish but was in
  fact unselfish. By looking after my own needs I was able to be healthier and
  happier, have a more positive and productive approach to my life and
  contribute more to the lives of those in my life, particularly my son who was
  only 6 at the time.

  My life began to move forward. Putting my Yoga into action took some focus,
  practice and some breaks to remind how much better I felt when I returned, it
  took some time. Over the years I explored different styles Bikram Hot Yoga,
  Vinyasa Flow, Ashtanga, Iyengar, Scaravelli, my understanding deepened and my
  practice developed. 


  In 2015 I took the opportunity for voluntary redundancy from my pretty intense
  corporate marketing job. Although I had achieved my goal of a successful
  marketing career it had become my entire focus and measurement of success, it
  had taken over and again I had become disconnected. I took the blessing and
  lesson offered and grabbed the opportunity for a new start and to begin to
  create a life that better served mySelf. 


  I was blessed to be able to spend time in an ashram with Samyak Yoga School in
  Mysore, India training to become a teacher in the Ashtanga Yoga lineage. 


  This was the first step on my journey as a teacher and I have continued to
  train to expand my teaching in Vinyasa Flow, Yin, Restorative and Pregnancy
  Yoga and will continue to learn, develop my own practice which I share through
  my teaching.


  I now realise that, on many occasions in my past, life had been attempting to
  ‘wake me up’ to mySelf, to connect me, in a more intuitive way, to the innate
  ability \[that we all share] to create my life in my vision.
